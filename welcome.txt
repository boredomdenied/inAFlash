This is a POC/Demo app. It is intended as a means to show off an idea only. This is not intended for production. It requires two devices to test the functionality. You can use emulators or a physical device, but must be able to spoof the GPS coordinates. When devices are within 100 meters of each other, the second activity kicks off. Please enter in two GPS coordinates that correspond to a distance greater than 100M, then you can copy one devices GPS to another and see the changes. The second activity will kick off in a matter of seconds.
