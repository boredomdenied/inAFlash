Problem:

  Several years back now I took an Uber and started chatting with the driver. I asked how he liked the job and he said it was overall good; however sometimes things can get chaotic. I asked if he wouldnâ€™t mind elaborating and was told of a situation where his fare would be at a large event. Arriving to a crowd of participants looking for their Uber/Lyft, it was confusing to match fare with ride. Instantaneously I solved this problem.
