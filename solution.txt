Solution:

I saw a scene with driver and rider phones flashing the same color and number. This was a link which could provide both parties the means to verify each other. The rider will orient their displays so that the screen is facing out towards the rides streaming by after the “your driver is arriving” is displayed. From the drivers POV, they see a card with the same pattern within their app and can view the match outside amongst the crowd. Two way verification can be had by driver rolling down the window and showing it back to the rider.
